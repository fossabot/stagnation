Requirements:

Before start familiarize yourself with the basic guides:
- [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

1. **Install JDK version 11**

- go to the [website](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11), and choose the version that compatible with your system<br>
  `If you are running a 64bit verison of Windows (standard), select Windows x64`
- Download and install like any normal application.

2. **Install Intellij IDEA**
- Visit [official IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) website,
- scroll down and you will see a download under the "Community Edition".
- Download and install like any normal application.

3. **Setup the project**
- Fork this repository.
- Open IntelliJ
- Click `File` -> `New` -> Project from `Version Control`
- Paste the URL of your fork repository in the URL field, click `Done`
- Wait for the repository to clone.
- Now Navigate to the `Server` folder inside the file browser from left side, and locate file `pom.xml`
- Right click this, and click `Add as Maven Project` wait a while for everything to load.

4. **Running the project**
- if you have gone through all the previous steps, in the intelij on the right side you will find a `maven` tab.
- Click it, expand the list named `lifecycle`, then Click `compile`, wait until the process is complete.
- If all the steps have been done correctly, you should receive information that the project has been built correctly.

5. Running the client. 

- To play you will need a **client**, unfortunately you will not find it here.
- I can only recommend you to download it from official repository [![download_button](https://i.imgur.com/rJsueNx.png)](https://gitlab.com/2009scape/rt4-client/-/artifacts)

<summary>Launching the game as singleplayer mode) (<b>setting up the project is not required</b>) </summary>

### Installation process

***

- Make sure you have `java 11` installed before running the process. If you don't have, you can download it from [this page](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11).
- If you already have java installed or had it, you will have to download this archive. <br>At the top right of the page you will find a green button `code` click it, and then press the `Download ZIP` button.

![install_process_0](https://i.imgur.com/3RsP9EC.png)

- After download, go to the location where you saved the archive and then extract it, (_Where you want_).

***

- Ok, now we need to build the **server.jar**, in the first folder, find the `run.bat` and **click it**. <br>
- If you have properly installed java, you should see a cmd console, informing you that the process has been started.

![install_process_1](https://i.imgur.com/zxhUewI.png)

- This process takes _about 15 minutes_. After the whole procedure is completed,
- console should close automatically, if this does not happen, close it manually.

- Now we make sure that the process has finished correctly. 
- If so, in the server folder should be `server.jar` (If not, run `run.bat` again).

![install_process_2](https://i.imgur.com/wgxyxpz.png)


- To play you will need a **client**, unfortunately you will not find it here.
- I can only recommend you to download it from official repository [![download_button](https://i.imgur.com/rJsueNx.png)](https://gitlab.com/2009scape/rt4-client/-/artifacts)
- After you got it, move on. (_Btw: Client can be anywhere on the disk_).

### Launch process

***

- In **server** folder, find the `launch.bat`, run it, select by typing `1` and confirm with `eneter` Done. (_the first load takes some time_).

![run_process_2](https://i.imgur.com/OuB8R67.png)

- When the server is ready you will see such information:

![run_process_2](https://i.imgur.com/gGVZT3W.png)

- Now, run the **client**, and enjoy the game.

### Additional information

- If you want to change the default settings, edit the **default.conf** file. Can be found in the archive in the **worldprops** folder.
- If you want to give yourself the **administrator rights** (_or not_), edit config and change the `noauth_default_admin` from `false` to `true`, and save the changes.

- If you made config changes while you had the server running, you will have to **re-run it**.
