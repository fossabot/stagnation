Sober-up Skippy south-east of Rimmington

Player: "Well, I could dump this bucket of water over him. That would sober him up a little."

	"Throw the water!"
		Player: "Hey, Skippy!"
		Skippy: "What?"
		*throws water*
		Skippy: "Ahhhhhhhhhhgh! That's cold! Are you trying to kill me?"
		Player: "Nope. Just sober you up. Memory coming back yet?"
		Skippy: "No. But I could do with a bowl of tea to warm myself up a bit. Go grab me one and we'll talk."
		Player: "Any particular type of tea?"
		Skippy: "Nettle for preference. Just make sure it's hot."
		Skippy: "And don't throw it at me!"
		Player: "What's your problem? You're all clean now."

	"I think I'll leave it for now"
	
Place nettles in a bowl of water and heat it up, then put it in a teacup.
	
Talk to Skippy.

Player: "Hey, Skippy!" 
Skippy: "Gaah! Don't drench me again!"
Player: "Hey! I only did that once! Try not to be such a big baby!"
Skippy: "So what are you here for then?"
Player: "I've come to give you your tea."
Skippy: "Excellent! I was thinking I was going to freeze out here!"
"Skippy drinks the tea and clutches his forehead in pain."
Skippy: "Ohhhhh..."
Player: "What? What's wrong?"
Skippy: "Not so loud...I think I have a hangover..."
Player: "Great...Well, I doubt you can remember anything through a hangover. What a waste of nettle tea..."
Skippy: "Hey! A little sympathy here?"
Skippy: "Owwowwoww... must remember not to shout..."
Skippy: "Look, I do know a hangover cure. If you can get me a bucket of the stuff I think I'll be okay."
Player: "Wait... is this cure a bucket of chocolate milk and snape grass?"
Skippy: "Yes! That's the stuff!"
Player: "Ahhh. Yes, I've made some of that stuff before. I should be able to get you some, no problem."
<end dialogue, quest progresses>

Combine chocolate into a bucket of milk, then use the snape grass on it.

Talk to Skippy

Player: "Hey, Skippy!"
Skippy: "Egad! Don't you know not to shout around a guy with a hangover?"
Skippy: "Ahhhhhg...No more shouting for me..."
Skippy: "What is it anyway?"
Player: "Well, Skippy, you will no doubt be glad to hear that I got you your hangover cure!"
Skippy: "Gimme!"
"Skippy chugs the hangover cure... very impressive."
Skippy: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."
Skippy: "Much better..."
Player: "Feeling better?"
Skippy: "Considerably."
Player: "Then tell me where the mudskippers are!"
Skippy: "I wish yuo wouldn't go looking for them. Those vicious killers will tear you apart."
Skippy: "It's becoming clear to me now..."
Skippy: "I was fishing using a Fishing Explosive."
Player: "A Fishing Explosive?"
Skippy: "Well, Slayer Masters sell these highly volatine potions for killing underwater creatures."
Skippy: "If you don't feel like lobbing a net about all day you can use them to fish with..."
Skippy: "But this time I was startled by what I thought was a giant mudskipper."
Skippy: "What it was, infact, was a..."
Skippy: "Dramatic Pause..."
Skippy: "A Mogre!"
Player: "What exactly is a Mogre?"
Skippy: "A Mogre is a type of Ogre that spends most of its time underwater."
Skippy: "They hunt giant mudskippers by wearing their skins and swimming close until they can attack them."
Skippy: "When I used the Fishing Explosives I scared off all the fish, and so the Mogre got out of the water to express its extreme displeasure."
Skippy: "With an iron mace."
Player: "I take it the head injury is responsible for the staggering and yelling?"
Skippy: "No, no."
Skippy: "My addiction to almost-lethal alcohol did that."
Skippy: "But if you are set on finding these Mogres just head south from here until you find Mudskipper Point."
Player: "The mudskipper-eating monsters are to be found at Mudskipper point?"
Player: "Shock!"
Player: "Thanks. I'll be careful."
